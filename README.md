# EDA_SQL_pumpkin_prices_atlanta_losangeles
EDA for best time to grocery store to purchase pumpkins 
This is a SQL EDA of pumpkin prices in Atlanta and Los Angeles to compare the two datasets. The Analysis on these two locations looked at Average Pricing for a retailer to pay for pumpkins based on different attributes and timing. I am looking to build 1 year of SQL experience as a Data Analyst through Part-Time  Internships, Pro Bono Work, and paid work when I am not working at my full time job.
